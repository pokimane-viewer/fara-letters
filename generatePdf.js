Joe Doe’s recent description of modern JavaScript back‑end development contains several fundamental inaccuracies. The points below clarify where his reasoning fails and why these distinctions matter in practice.

1. Express.js is **not** “just Node with endpoints.”
   • Express wraps Node’s low‑level \`http\` module, providing a declarative **routing layer**, a flexible **middleware pipeline**, robust **error handling**, and a pluggable ecosystem of third‑party middleware.  
   • Endpoints alone do **not** constitute a RESTful API. REST depends on uniform resource identification, stateless interactions, content negotiation, hypermedia, and standard HTTP semantics. Express gives you the tooling to honor those constraints; Node’s core API does not.

2. Node.js is **not** a “JavaScript version” of Python, C++, or any other language.
   • Node is a **runtime** built on the V8 engine that executes JavaScript *outside* the browser. Its event‑driven, non‑blocking I/O model is tuned for highly concurrent I/O‑bound workloads.  
   • Python and C++ are general‑purpose languages with very different concurrency, type, and memory models; equating them ignores these architectural and performance distinctions.

3. Security practices at scale far exceed “hashed_pw.txt.”
   • Mature platforms such as Twitch employ salted, iterated password hashing (e.g., bcrypt/Argon2) stored in managed secrets infrastructure—never flat files.  
   • Operational security includes strict IAM, hardware security modules, TLS everywhere, audit logging, and layered defense‑in‑depth—none of which resemble a plain text or simple hash file.

4. Why the nuance matters.
   • Underestimating Express leads to under‑engineered middleware chains, brittle routing, and lack of observability.  
   • Misunderstanding Node’s concurrency model results in CPU‑bound code that blocks the event loop, annihilating performance.  
   • Dismissing real‑world security architecture invites insecure design decisions that break compliance and user trust.

In short, Joe Doe’s statement glosses over the very features that make these technologies successful in production. Recognizing their true capabilities—and limitations—enables maintainable, secure, and performant systems.
